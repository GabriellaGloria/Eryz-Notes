# Series 🧸
### Arithmetic Series 🖼
The sum of the terms in an arithmetic series is given by:
$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a + (n-1) d \right)
$$
where $$\(a\)$$ is the first term, $$\(d\)$$ is the common difference, and $$\(n\)$$ is the number of terms.

### Geometric Series 🍭
The sum of the terms in a geometric series is given by:
$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad \text{for} \, r \neq 1
$$
where $$\(a\)$$ is the first term, $$\(r\)$$ is the common ratio, and $$\(n\)$$ is the number of terms.

### Natural Number Series 🍬
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ natural numbers is:
$$
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

### Even Number Series 🍫
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ even numbers is:
$$
S_n = n(n+1)
$$

### Odd Number Series 🍿
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ odd numbers is:
$$
S_n = n^2
$$

### Perfect Square Series 🍩
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ perfect squares is:
$$
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

### Cubic Series 🍪
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ cubes is:
$$
S_n = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
$$

### Quartic Series 🍯
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ quartic numbers is:
$$
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3n-1)}{30}
$$

### Quintic Series 🧋
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ quintic numbers is:
$$
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3n-1)(4n^3+6n^2-3n-1)}{120}
$$

### Consecutive Two Numbers 🍟
The sum of the product of two consecutive numbers is:
$$
1 \times 2 + 2 \times 3 + \cdots + n(n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3}
$$

### Consecutive Three Numbers 🥨
The sum of the product of three consecutive numbers is:
$$
1 \times 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 3 \times 4 + \cdots + n(n+1)(n+2) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{4}
$$

### Fraction with Consecutive Multiplying Denominators 🥞
The sum of fractions with consecutive multiplication in the denominator is:
$$
\frac{1}{1 \times 2} + \frac{1}{2 \times 3} + \frac{1}{3 \times 4} + \cdots = \frac{n}{n+1}
$$


### Triangular Number Series 🍳
The sum of the first $$\(n\)$$ triangular numbers $$\(1, 3, 6, 10, ... \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)$$ is:
$$
S_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}
$$
