## About CS2040S - Data Structures & Algorithms ðŸ“–

**CS2040S NUSMods : [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2040S/data-structures-and-algorithms)**

I took CS2040S in **AY2324 Semester 2**, under Prof Seth Gilbert & Prof Arnab Bhattacharya. 

CS2040S covers topics about **data structure and algorithms design and analysis**. First lecture is introduction to Java, but it was not tested (it is not main focus of this course). The course teaches various data structures (like trees, graphs, tries, and heaps), algorithmic techniques (including DFS, BFS, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms), and complexity analysis. It aims to build strong problem-solving skills and prepares students for tackling real-world computational challenges. 

This course has Midterms and Finals. Assignments are given on Coursemology. There are weekly coding assignments & quizzes. Again, I scored quite well on Midterms but my final was quite bad ðŸ¤§. The coding assignments uses Java.

Personally, I think each topic is quite rushed, but everything is still well taught (I liked the tree topics part) ðŸŒ´. I also liked the tutorial questions, it was quite challenging and fun!

**Enjoyment : 4/5 ðŸ«¶**</br>
**Workload : 5-7h/week (2h lecture, 2h tutorials, 2h assignment & quizzes)**</br>
**Grade : A**</br>
