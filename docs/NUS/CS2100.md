## About CS2100 - Computer Organisation 🧑‍💻

**CS2100 NUSMods : [link](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2100/computer-organisation)**

I took CS2100 in **AY2324 Semester 2**, under Prof Aaron Tan. 

CS2100 introduces students to the **fundamental principles of computer systems and architecture**. The first half of this course mainly focuses on C introduction & MIPS Assembly. The course explores topics such as digital logic circuits, data representation, machine-level instructions, ISA, and MIPS assembly language 😎. CS2100 also explains about cache, pipelining, and sequential logic. By connecting high-level programming to low-level hardware operations, CS2100 bridges the gap between software and hardware, offering a understanding of how computers execute programs 🫡.

The lectures are online videos on Canvas, but there's offline weekly recitations. Each week has many content videos (around 2-4h worth of vids).

This course has Midterms and Finals. There are also some quizzes & written assignments on Canvas. Midtems & Finals are openbook (printed materials), using Examplify ✅.

The topics covered in CS2100 were mostly new to me, and I personally liked it, although I find the questions were tedious, but CS2100 was a nice intro to lower level stuff 💓.

**Workload : 5-6h/week (3h lecture, 1h tutorial, 1h lab, 1h assignemnts)**</br>
