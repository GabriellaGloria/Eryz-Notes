## About CS1010 - Programming Methodology ðŸ¤Ÿ

I took CS1010 in **AY2324 Semester 1**, under Prof Wei Tsang and taught CS1010 in AY2425 Semester 1 as a TA. I enjoyed how this course is structured, and in my opinion its the best 1010 course (hehe, I'm biased tho ðŸ˜¼). It was my first time learning memory management & allocations.

CS1010 is an **introductory course to programming**, using C language. The course primarily focuses on C programming, algorithm design (flowcharts), memory management, and problem-solving. Topics covered include conditionals, loops, arrays, pointers, recursion, and data structures, with an emphasis on developing efficient and maintainable code. Students also learn to use Unix tools and GitHub for collaboration, along with a specialized CS1010 I/O library. The course is designed to build a strong programming foundation for those new to coding.

This course has 3 Programming exams, Midterm, and Finals. There are also weekly quizzes on Canvas and 8 programming assignments. I scored quite well on midterm and PEs, but my final score was bad ðŸ˜”.

Overall CS1010 was such a fun module!

**Enjoyment : 4.5/5 ðŸ«¶**</br>
**Workload : 5-7h/week (2h lecture, 2h lab, 2h assignment & quizzes)**</br>
**Grade : A**</br>
