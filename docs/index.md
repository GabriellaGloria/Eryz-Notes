# Hi there 👋!
I am Gabriella Gloria, an Indonesian undergraduate at NUS 🎓. I am majoring in Computer Science 💻, currently a Y2 student :D! I am still exploring many CS fields and hope to learn more throughout uni.

My interest (currently) lies in Cybersecurity, but I did a bit of Competitive Programming back then (C++ best language I agree 😗🔛🔝). Oh, I also like chocolates 🍫 and sushi 🍣.

## eryz-notes 🙇‍♀️
This page is just for me to document things and also my progress, so in the next few years, I can look back & see how stupid and cringe I was. 

Idk how you found this page, but thanks for visiting, hope you enjoyed it 🫶!!
